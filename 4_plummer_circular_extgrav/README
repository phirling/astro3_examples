This example follows particles in an EXTERNAL plummer potential on circular trajectories.

To use it, SWIFT has to be compiled with the flag --with-ext-potential=point-mass-softened (set at configuration time).

Be careful to set the parameters of the external potential (in params.yml) to the same values as those of the IC file
(set in makeIC.py). Namely, the position, softening length and total mass of the potential. The postition is equivalent
to the shift.

The default is a potential with softening length 0.1 and total mass 1.0.

For this example, SWIFT was compiled with the following configuration:

./configure --disable-compiler-warnings --disable-doxygen-doc --disable-hand-vec --with-ext-potential=point-mass-softened --with-hdf5=/usr/local/hdf5/bin/h5cc --with-metis=/usr/local/

(The location of the hdf5 and metis libraries may vary on your system)
