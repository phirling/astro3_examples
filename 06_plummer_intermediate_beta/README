Example 6: Plummer model with arbitrary anisotropy
==================================================

In this example, the mass distribution again follows a Plummer model. However, now, the velocity distribution
is generated so that it satisfies the Jeans Equation for arbitrary (constant) values of the anisotropy
parameter "beta" seen in class:
beta = 1 - (sigma_phi^2 + sigma_theta^2)/2sigma_r^2

Recall that:
beta = -inf: purely circular orbits
beta = 0: isotropic (ergodic) orbits
beta = 1: purely radial orbits

The first case has already been tested in the previous example. Here, we can play around with values in the
interval (-inf,1]. The two examples shown in the lecture, along with the commands used to generate the
corresponding IC file are:

1. beta = 0
python makeIC.py

2. beta = 0.875
python makeIC.py -beta 0.875

By default, the ICs contain 256k particles. This number can be changed with the -N argument.
The makeIC script also prints an estimate of the characteristic time of the system, chosen as the period of
a circular orbit at the Plummer radius a. With the default parameters, the system is evolved for about six
characteristic periods.

After running SWIFT, the resulting output can be visualized using the provided script. To make the film shown
in class, the parameters are:
-shift 10 -lim 10 -cmap afmhot -nbins 800 -frsp 0.4 -interp bilinear -fps 50 --savefilm

For reference, here are the exact commands used to produce the beta=0.875 movie:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
python makeIC.py -beta 0.875
mkdir snap
bash run.sh
python ../visualize.py snap/snapshot_*.hdf5 -shift 10 -lim 10 -cmap afmhot -nbins 700 -frsp 0.4 -interp bilinear -fps 50 --savefilm
